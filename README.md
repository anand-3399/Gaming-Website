# gaming-website
In this project, I have created a prototype of a gaming website using HTML and CSS.
I have included all the major attributes of HTML and used some of the advance CSS concepts like Gradient and Hower images. Certain attributes like inline block elements, display:block
and othe things I have included so that it is looking very attractive.

Above is the link of my webpage. Please visit it in Laptop or Tab. Visiting it in Mobile Screen is not compatible as i have not designed for mobile viewing.

Another thing is I have also created a prototype of a AJ-Store. This is just a prototype and i am continuously upgrading it on monthly basis.
Do visit the below link also. You can visit the below link in Laptop, Tab or Mobile Screen. Hope you enjoyed seeing my website.
